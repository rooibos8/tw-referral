  "serviceTitle": "This is a tool for sharing estimates of Twitter user's age",
  "serviceDescription": "In order to protect them who are under the age of 18 from R18 content, we have using 'Limited access only Twitter list members/Twitter followers' features of some services like Poipiku or Privatter in Japanese creators community on Twitter. \n But it's always very tough work guessing a follower's age from a bio, tweets, or something by alone. Also, we don't have any official SaaS to verify the age instant on internet, so I created this tool. \n The concept is \"Share Your Judgement\" in terms of verifying age. \n I hope this tool helps individual creators be able to share their works with the community safer & easier.",
